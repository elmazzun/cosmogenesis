# Cosmogenesis

Will man ever be able to create an artificial Universe?
It seems to me the most ambicious experiment we will ever be able to perform and one of the possible
ways to escape two of the three possible Universe final fates: Big Freeze and Big Rip.
Escaping into our own artificial Universe would imply an almost divine level of manipulation of matter.

## Why this

I'm absolutely no scientist and I'm speculating about cosmogenesis just as
a mental exercise in order to learn some cool physics and mathematics.
